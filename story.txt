In a jungle filled with animals of all sorts there once was a lion named Simba. Simba was a gifted lion at hunting insects. He was able to run and jump higher than all the other animals. This gave him the ability to catch insects in under two minutes. He held the record for most slugs eaten in one sitting. His friends, Timbone and Pumba, were impressed and challenged him to a duel.
