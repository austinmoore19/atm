In a jungle filled with animals of all sorts there once was a lion named Simba. 
Simba was a gifted lion at hunting insects. He was able to run and jump higher than 
all the other animals. This gave him the ability to catch insects in under two 
minutes. He held the record for most slugs eaten in one sitting. His friends, 
Timbone and Pumba, were impressed and challenged him to a duel.

Due to his competitive nature, Simba did not want to lose this duel. He ventured
deep in the jungle to a place of legend said to contain more slugs than one could 
imagine. Simba arrived in a clearing, where he saw an animal partially hidden in the shadows. 
This animal was different. It was not like any other animal Simba had ever seen.
"You dare disturb my domain?" this strange creature roared.
"I only wish to find slugs, you see, I must train for a competition I am having with
my friends," Simba replied.
The creature moved forward, giving Simba a clear look at it. It was a giant slug,
maybe 15 feet in lenght. Suddenly feeling scared, Simba cautiously observed the
monster as he thought about how he should proceed.

Before Simba could do anything, the creature lunged forward.
Simba luckily was able to evade the attack due to the slug's sluggish speed.
"Hey what was that for?" Simba shouted.
"I know who you are, you have long disturbed the peace of slugkind." said the slug.
"I'm... so sorry." Simba replied.
"Well now you MUST PAY!"
